King's Polynomial Generating Function Calculator
Overview
This Python program calculates the generating function for the King's polynomial using a recursive approach. The generating function is represented by the recursive formula:

𝑅(𝐶,𝑟)=𝑥⋅𝑅(𝐶1,𝑟)+𝑅(𝐶2,𝑟)

where:
R(C,r) is the generating function for the King's polynomial.

C the shape we are working on

r represends the kings we are placing
Usage
Input:
First give the program the rows and cols of your shape eg 3 3
then your shape:
0 0 0
0 0 0
0 0 0

putting 1's means no king is allowed in that particular province.


Execution: Run the Python script to compute the generating function. The program will output the result of R(C,r).
